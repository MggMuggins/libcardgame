# libcardgame
D Library for Manipluating Decks of cards and building simple card games. I Created my original implementation of this library in Swift, in order to see what that language was like, and play around, because I needed a trivial problem to solve. I learned that this was less of a trivial problem, and I didn't much like Swift, so I rewrote it in D and have been expanding quite a bit. If anyone is interested in actually using this thing, please open an issue entitled "Documentation" or the like, and I'm more than willing to write up some basic stuff to get you familiar with the classes and what they do. You can ask even if I haven't committed to the project in a while.
